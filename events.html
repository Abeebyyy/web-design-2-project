        <br>
        <br>
        There were 7 rounds in total, with only 1 week to prepare props, choreography, stage outfits, and songs before they had to be performed. The Boyz came in first place for nearly every round, and won the show in the end. Below are some of their best performances.</p>

        <div class="rtkk">
          <h4>Danger</h4>
          <p>Danger (originally by Taemin) was the first full performance shown by TBZ on RTK. They performed the theme of robbers/thiefs stealing the crown. In this round, they also showcased many "magic tricks" and difficult stunts that blew many audience members away. This performance won first place.</p>

        <div class="rtkk">
          <h4>REVEAL (Catching fire)</h4>
          <p>REVEAL (re-composed song by The Boyz) is the second part to Danger's story, where they lose the crown and have a revolution. This is done in fantastic story-telling using choreography and stage props. The Boyz use real fire and have huge flags they stand on held up by people during the climax. This performance was also ranked first.</p>

          <h4>Quasi Una Fantasia</h4>
          <p>The fourth round of the competition showed TBZ performing a re-vamped version of VIXX's Shangri-La. The Boyz explored a different style of dance for this stage: contemporary and ballet, to fit the theme of the song. It is a beautiful song paired with beautiful and intricate choreography. This performance came in second.</p>
